# Convert-into-PAA
Originally created for the non-profit organization [Projets Edaly](https://edaly.fr/fr/home) - [Github Projets Edaly](https://github.com/Projets-Edaly), i decided to share this script that converts png or tga files into paa files.
The first version will be for single files (right-click on a file) and later i'll add another script that add a contextual menu item to convert all images in the folder into paa files.

## Install
Run with PowerShell
```
.\install-ImageToPAA.ps1
```

## Uninstall
Run with PowerShell
```
.\uninstall-ImageToPAA.ps1
```

## Usage
Right click on any image you want to build into PAA.

**Note: You can select multiple files and convert them into paa.**
